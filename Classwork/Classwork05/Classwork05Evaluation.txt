Classwork05 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Pretty good test coverage, but you could always do more...

Throwing two exceptions intentionally means that you have
to CATCH at least the first one so the other one has a
chance to throw.

Keep up the good work, though, you're doing great!
