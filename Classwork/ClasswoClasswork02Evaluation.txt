Classwork02 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

I don't think this actually works.  You have the operations in the
SourceFile.java and TargetFile.java in main() methods in those files.
While this works for standalone, it doesn't actuall work for using
those classes in a package.  You need to have a method, or use the
constructor, to get the operations to happen from the MyFileCopier
class.
