Homework02 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

You could use a few more tests in your code.  Remember that there
is no such thing as "too much testing".  The more tests you do, the
more likely it is you will catch bugs and errors.  It's not hard to
do with these programs, because it's mostly copy and paste anyhow!
It also helps to write "System.out.println()" messages to tell the
user what is going on -- don't assume that the user will be able to
read your code and decipher what you are doing....
